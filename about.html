    <p>
        Transitioning from an English medium school to an electronics and communication engineering college was a pivotal shift for me. Embracing challenges, I delved into the world of circuits and signals. Now, as an ambitious learner, I find myself upskilling in information technology, analytics, and technology consulting. The journey from circuits to analytics is a testament to my adaptability and hunger for knowledge. It's not just about evolving academically; it's about staying ahead in a tech-driven world. Each step fuels my passion for innovation, pushing boundaries to bridge the gap between electronics and the vast possibilities of technology consulting.
